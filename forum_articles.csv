Forum: MSF’s review of Megan Khung case should look into empowering social workers,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","The media has been abuzz with reports on the tragic death of four-year-old Megan Khung, following a year of physical abuse in her home.
A report in The Straits Times (Megan Khung’s death: At least 7 other fatal child abuse cases in Singapore over past 10 years, April 8) cited seven other cases of fatal child abuse in the past 10 years, with the children’s ages ranging from two weeks to 11 years.
In Megan’s case, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) attributed the “inadequate” interventions by the social agencies involved to Megan’s pre-school report “not fully describing the severity of her injuries” (Info from Megan Khung’s pre-school gave no reason for ECDA to suspect girl’s abuse: MSF, April 8)
Media reports point to a collective failure of the system  and a series of lapses in the reporting of abuse and follow-up checks.
MSF has since said it will further review the case (MSF planning further review of Megan Khung’s case, covering responses of all parties, April 11).
This move should help restore public trust in our system to protect children.
I have three points to make regarding the review.
First, the review should examine not just the responses of the various social agencies per se. It should also investigate any underlying human or organisational factors that might have contributed to inadequacies of responses.
Second, because broader issues may be involved, MSF should invite representations, written or oral, from interested parties such as the Singapore Children’s Society (SCS), Children’s Aid Society and Society Against Family Violence. They would likely have observations, insights and suggestions to contribute. In fact, SCS has already made two recommendations relating to child protection in pre-schools   (Social workers say the system failed to protect Megan Khung; pre-school not solely responsible, April 10).
Third, I suggest that MSF also review whether social workers dealing with child abuse cases can be more empowered. For example, can lying to a social worker investigating a child abuse complaint be made an offence? Can a social worker be empowered to exercise discretion and make a 999 call for police assistance to enter a home to look for a child? An alternative would be to have a special police hotline for such calls.
MSF’s review should be a comprehensive one. No stone should be left unturned.

Forum: Time for an independent child fatality review panel to prevent more tragedies,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","The recent sentencing in Megan Khung’s case (Abuse, death of four-year-old girl: Mum jailed 19 years, boyfriend gets 30 years’ jail, 17 strokes, April 3) and the subsequent review of inter-agency processes (Info from Megan Khung’s pre-school gave no reason for ECDA to suspect girl’s abuse: MSF, April 8) have brought to light deep concerns for Singapore to reflect upon as a society.
The Singapore Children’s Society has rightly proposed stronger training and capacity-building initiatives, and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has implemented procedural improvements to strengthen the child protection system.
However, beyond improving detection and response mechanisms, Megan’s case highlights a more profound issue: the growing fear, sorrow and mistrust that tragic cases like hers leave in their wake – among the public, communities and even professionals tasked with protecting children.
When such tragedies occur, they shake confidence in the system and leave many painful questions unanswered. If we are to truly rebuild public trust and demonstrate that every effort is being made to learn from these fatal outcomes, Singapore must seriously consider establishing an independent child fatality review panel, legislated under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA).
This panel would be empowered by law to:
Access records and information across agencies and professionals involved in a child’s life;
Conduct in-depth reviews of child fatality cases;
Identify systemic failures or missed opportunities for intervention;
Publish findings and recommendations to improve the child protection system; and
Monitor follow-up actions and compliance to proposed reforms.
Other countries have already taken this step. In the United States, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act  requires every state to have a child death review panel to identify preventable factors in child deaths and recommend strategies for systemic improvement. Closer to home, Hong Kong’s Child Fatality Review Panel systematically reviews child deaths, publishes reports, and provides accessible insights to the public.
A legislated panel must also be transparent – publishing its findings, acknowledging systemic lapses, and openly sharing lessons learnt.
Importantly, to ensure true transparency and public confidence, the panel must be made up of individuals who are impartial, independent of the agencies involved in the case, and free from any conflict of interest. This ensures objectivity and removes the risk of perceived bias in the review process.
Transparency not only fosters learning and improvement across agencies, but also assures the public that no death is ignored. It honours the child’s life and affirms that every child’s life matters. When a child dies, it is our moral responsibility to ensure that the tragedy is thoroughly examined and used to drive change.
Establishing such a panel would send a powerful signal of Singapore’s political and social commitment to child welfare and child rights. It would show that our society values every child’s life and is determined to learn and improve – fairly, consistently, and with integrity.
Since 2015, we have lost a number of children to fatal abuse. Out of them, at least eight were not known to social services at the point of their death.
These were not just statistics; they were lives that could have been saved. We owe it to Megan – and to the seven others – to do better. The time to act is now.
Singapore must take clear, legislative steps to implement structural change in how we review and learn from these tragedies. We can – and must – build a system where no child falls through the cracks again.

Forum: Community groups are key stakeholders in crisis response,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Ms Norhaiyah Mahmood for her letter “Beyond counter-terror drills, people have a vital role to play” (April 4), and her appreciation for the efforts of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Ministry of Defence.
We agree with Ms Norhaiyah that counter-terrorism and emergency preparedness are necessarily whole-of-society efforts.
Community groups are key stakeholders, and we are heartened that many have come forward to contribute.
Under the SGSecure national movement, MHA and the People’s Association work closely to engage community groups through platforms such as the Community Response Roundtables (CRRT). The CRRT comprises key representatives from schools, businesses, and grassroots, religious and other community organisations within a geographic area, to facilitate collaboration and preparedness against terror threats. Table-top and crisis response exercises are conducted for CRRT members. The exercises help them to prepare for emergencies, and support the community after an attack.
MHA also works with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth to engage community groups through the racial and religious harmony circles. The harmony circles have established strong rapport and familiarity with local community leaders. These networks facilitate the timely dissemination of information, and the restoration of confidence and trust between communities during crises. The harmony circles regularly participate in crisis response exercises, to prepare them to address any racial and religious tensions.
We thank our community and public sector partners for championing SGSecure to keep Singapore safe and secure.

"Forum: Hold vendors to same high cyber security standards, or they may become weakest link","UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","I read with concern the recent news that DBS and Bank of China (Singapore) customers had their personal data stolen in a ransomware attack targeting a printing vendor (More than 11,000 DBS, Bank of China customers’ information compromised after data attack on vendor, April 7).
While it is reassuring that customer accounts and login details were not compromised, this incident reminds us that cyber security is not only about protecting our own systems, but also about ensuring our partners do the same.
In this case, the breach did not happen within the banks themselves. It occurred at Toppan Next Tech, a third-party vendor tasked with printing customer letters and statements. The data stolen reportedly includes names, addresses, and in some cases, account information. Such data can be exploited in phishing attacks or identity theft, especially when combined with other online sources.
The banks were quick to clarify that their systems were unaffected, but as members of the public, we might ask: Shouldn’t the banks be responsible for ensuring their vendors are just as secure?
Many businesses today rely on external vendors for printing, cloud storage, or customer support. However, if these vendors are not held to the same cyber security standards, they may become the weakest link in the chain. In the cyber security industry, this is often referred to as “third-party risk”.
Cyberattacks are growing in both frequency and impact, and it is commendable that the Cyber Security Agency and Monetary Authority of Singapore are taking this incident seriously.
But moving forward, we must shift from a mindset of “reacting to incidents” to “preventing them through stronger oversight”, especially where customer data is involved.
Trust is hard-earned, and in the digital world, it’s built not just on what companies do themselves, but also on whom they choose to trust.

Forum: Holistic approach to assessing teleconsultation is key,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Dr Wong Tien Hua for sharing his views (Ultra-short teleconsultations can’t ensure quality of medical care, April 8).
MaNaDr agrees fully that the quality of teleconsultations must be determined holistically and always in the best interest of patients, and not just by duration.
The one-minute timer we introduced on the platform serves as a starting point and a guide; it is not an endorsement or recommendation that one minute is the right length of time for a consultation.
As Dr Wong has noted, there are instances where a consultation will need to run longer, and conversely, in some other cases such as more straightforward follow-ups, there is no need for an overly long consultation. Still, this guard rail – one of many we have implemented – is a clear reminder to doctors of their responsibility to put patients first. 
We will keep engaging with our stakeholders to collectively uphold a safe, ethical and effective platform for digital care, and welcome Dr Wong to further talk with us to continue this important conversation on the future of healthcare in Singapore.

"Forum: Fire safety a personal responsibility, not just that of the authorities","UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","My deepest condolences to the family of the 10-year-old girl who died in the River Valley Road fire (10-year-old girl dies after fire breaks out at River Valley Road shophouse, April 8).
After the fire occurred, many questioned the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the building’s owner over alleged lapses in fire safety. But are they solely responsible?
During my travels across Europe, the US, Japan and Canada, I’ve seen many beautiful wooden houses – some built closely together and many featuring open fireplaces.
A building engineer once told me that such structures are considered fire hazards in Singapore and would not be approved by BCA. It’s curious that other First World countries allow them, yet severe house fires are relatively rare.
So, what makes the difference?
In these countries, residents do not play with fire – literally and figuratively. They are deeply conscious of fire risks and take personal responsibility for fire prevention.
Fire safety is not just a regulation; it’s a mindset. Unfortunately, in Singapore, many of us tend to rely solely on the authorities for safety and do not actively cultivate fire awareness as part of our daily lives.
We must ask ourselves if we are doing our part.
Fire safety should not be an afterthought or outsourced responsibility. It should be a shared commitment – starting with our homes, workplaces, schools and communities. We need to educate our children, check our fire exits, test our alarms, and stay vigilant.
Rather than questioning SCDF or BCA, we must also look inward. Fire safety is not just the job of the authorities – it’s a personal responsibility. Let’s take ownership, because when it comes to fire, prevention is the best protection.

Forum: Urgent need to step up fire prevention measures,"UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","The National Safety Council of Singapore is deeply concerned over the increasing number of fire incidents occurring in apartments and buildings across Singapore. These result not only in damage to property, but also in the loss of precious lives.
The recent fire in River Valley Road, where a 10-year-old girl tragically lost her life, is a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating consequences of such incidents (10-year-old girl dies after fire breaks out at River Valley Road shophouse, April 8).
In the past few years, Singapore has also seen other serious incidents, such as the fire in a Bedok North flat that claimed three lives, and a blaze in Yishun which left several residents injured and displaced.
These incidents point to a worrying trend that cannot be ignored. While the emergency services have performed admirably, it is clear that more needs to be done in the realm of fire prevention and public awareness.
These questions need to be asked: Are residents in Singapore sufficiently informed and equipped to handle fire risks? Are older buildings adequately maintained to meet modern fire safety standards? And are fire prevention inspections and drills being carried out with enough regularity and rigour?
There is a pressing need to strengthen fire safety protocols, especially in residential buildings. This includes more frequent checks on electrical systems, better enforcement of clutter regulations in common corridors, and ensuring every household has access to basic fire-fighting equipment such as smoke detectors and extinguishers. We also urge that fire safety education be more deeply embedded in schools and community outreach programmes.
Every fire that results in injury or death is one too many. Singapore must act now to protect its people from preventable tragedies.

"Letter of the week: Athletes with disabilities deserve equal space, coverage and respect","UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","I was amazed at the dedication, skill and sportsmanship the athletes exhibited, but also noticed that the arena was sparsely packed. When I shared this with my friends, most of them were unaware of the event or even the sport itself.
This points to a larger issue: the marginalisation of athletes with disabilities and the need to reimagine how we view both disability and sport.
All too often, society frames disability as a person’s defining characteristic, reducing complex individuals to a single label.
However, at the end of the day, these people live their lives with experiences similar to ours, albeit with a few challenges. They can be whoever they want to be – artists, thinkers, educators, athletes and so on. While their disability may influence how they navigate the world, it is not the sum of who they are.
Unfortunately, this reductive view is mirrored in how we treat sports for people with disabilities. These athletes are frequently portrayed as “inspirations” simply for existing, rather than being recognised for their skill and competitiveness.
This narrative, however well-intentioned, further “others” them. Instead, we need to shift towards genuine inclusion, where disabled athletes are given equal space, coverage and respect – not just admiration from afar.
One meaningful step would be to increase awareness of para sports in the media and schools. Broadcasting events like boccia tournaments on national platforms and integrating such sports into school co-curricular activities can significantly raise awareness and visibility, and foster a more inclusive environment.
Together, these efforts would help challenge the indifference that persists in society.
We must create more opportunities for people with disabilities to be seen, heard and celebrated for their abilities, not just as symbols of resilience but also as full, multifaceted individuals. By doing so, we take a step towards a more empathetic and equitable society. Integration is not charity; it is justice.
Inclusion through sport is powerful. It fosters mutual respect, encourages access, and allows future generations, disabled and non-disabled alike, to grow up with broader, richer ideas on who belongs where. And the answer should always be “Everyone, everywhere”.

"Forum: In a stormy world, Singapore must sail smarter","UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s parliamentary address on the US’ sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs rightly highlights a turning point in global trade – and for Singapore (US tariffs will significantly impact Singapore’s growth; Budget 2025 to help in short term: PM Wong, April 8).
As a small, open economy deeply dependent on the rules-based global order, we cannot afford to wait and watch.
We must reform, adapt, and lead with renewed purpose.
China describes its economy as an ocean that cannot be affected by tariff storms.
Singapore, by contrast, is a well-built smart ship: small, but brilliantly engineered – agile, precise and resilient.
We do not rely on scale to withstand turbulence. We rely on strategy, speed and the ability to adjust our sails when the winds shift.
To remain economically resilient, we must first diversify beyond traditional trade and logistics.
Investing in advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, green technology, biotechnology and digital services will place us on the front lines of global demand, making us less vulnerable to tariffs or political shocks.
Equally vital is growing our base of local enterprises.
In a digital, borderless world, companies can be born global but be built and anchored in Singapore.
With the right mix of funding, mentorship and regulatory support, we can nurture high-impact start-ups with global ambitions – while remaining a trusted hub for international entrepreneurs who choose to scale from our shores.
But to truly embed this transformation, we must begin with our young. Our schools should prepare students not just to work in digital companies, but also to build them.
Incorporating start-up labs, venture-based learning, coding and innovation projects into our curriculum can ignite entrepreneurial thinking early.
With support from industry mentors and start-up platforms, our students can move from ideas to prototypes while still in school, becoming creators, and not just consumers, of the future economy.
Large firms and government-linked companies must also play a catalytic role by spinning off innovation, co-building with small and medium-sized enterprises, and anchoring micro-clusters that drive new ecosystems of growth.
Singapore may be small – but we are the ship that does not sink. 
We can weather this storm by being a new, enterprising nation with a clear vision to be, yes, a great nation in our own way.

Forum: Customer care seems to have gone out the window,"UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","I couldn’t agree more with invest editor Tan Ooi Boon (Why poor customer service can cause businesses to fail; and Going digital should not be an excuse for poorer services, both April 6).
Unlike popular hawker stalls with long queues where the owners don’t have time for pleasantries, it’s different in the retail and service industries. With sales becoming more competitive, it’s crucial to make your customer service a cut above the rest.
But many companies seem to have stopped actively thinking and caring about service. Most of the time, customer service representatives just go by the book and have a robotic script as well as rules and guidelines they have to follow. 
I suspect sales staff are encouraged to get rid of the customer as quickly as possible so that they can cram more customers into a day and make a dollar or two more.
The mom-and-pop stores that many of us grew up with have been replaced by big companies. These companies look at their customers as numbers rather than people and do all they can to keep costs down. They assume if the price is right and supplies are in stock, people will keep shopping.
Customer service is expensive, and in most organisations the bulk of the budget goes to revenue-generating departments, not cost centres. 
These costs are why so many customer service departments are outsourced to other countries.
Making employees skilled in customer service requires talented and dedicated training and quality staff leveraging sophisticated systems and tools.
